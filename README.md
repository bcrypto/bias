## What is BIAS?

BIAS is a set of rules for constructing authentication frameworks, including 
requirements for their components and recommendations for implementation. 
The name BIAS plays on the acronym of "Identification & Authentication Systems".

The BIAS specification is influenced by the 
[ISO/IEC 29115](https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html) and especially 
[NIST SP 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) standards.
The specification covers the 
[OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and 
[OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) web technologies. 
It is scheduled to be adopted as a standard of Belarus in 2023.
